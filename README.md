# 🌱 vegan! oh, and...

A vegan recipe search engine aiming to spread cruelty-free eating, Vegan Oh And makes it easy for people with complex dietary needs to find delicious recipes.

Use tags as filters, write a search query to meet your cravings, and find recipes that you both can eat, and can't wait to eat!



## 👨‍💻 Tech
I built this from the ground up with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! Object-oriented principles guided this project's JavaScript development. Thenables powered asynchronous functions, pulling recipe data from Edamam's Recipe API.

## 🔨 Optimizations and Improvements

To improve this project, I have two goals. First, I plan to simplify the code by looping the addition of event listeners. Second, I will make this a fullstack application using Nodejs, where users can create accounts and save their favorite recipes, which will be stored with MongoDB.
